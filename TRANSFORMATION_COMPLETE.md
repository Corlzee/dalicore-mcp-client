## Key README Highlights

### Why This Fork?
Explains the data-driven approach:
- Analyzed 12,302 tool calls
- Found 7 tools = 97.5% of usage
- Cut the rest as bloat

### The 7 Essential Tools
Each tool documented with:
- Usage percentage
- Purpose
- Common use cases

### What We Cut
Lists removed tools with alternatives:
- `get_config` → Edit config file
- `create_directory` → Use `start_process("mkdir")`
- Interactive process tools → Use one-shot commands
- Etc.

### Smart Features
**System Awareness:**
- Auto-detects OS, shell, paths
- No separate tool call needed
- Sent to LLM on every connection

**Helpful Blocked Commands:**
- Example error messages shown
- Teaches correct tool usage
- Includes the "build files from pieces" tip you suggested

### Usage Examples
Code examples for each tool:
- Reading files (with offset/length)
- Writing files (chunking strategy)
- Editing code (fuzzy matching)
- Searching (content and filenames)
- Running commands

### Best Practices Section
- Chunking strategy (25-30 lines)
- Path usage (absolute paths)
- Command execution patterns
- Handling blocked commands

### Statistics Section
Shows the data:
- Top 5 tools: 93%
- Top 7 tools: 97.5%
- Other 18 tools: 2.5%
- Decision: Keep 7, cut 18

## Philosophy Embodied

**"Less is more (when backed by data)"**

We didn't arbitrarily cut tools. We analyzed 12,302 actual tool calls, identified the 7 that matter, and ruthlessly eliminated the rest. The result: faster, cleaner, more focused.

## Credits

- **Original Code:** Desktop Commander MCP by @wonderwhy-er
- **Data Analysis:** Based on real usage logs (12,302 calls)
- **Streamlining:** Dalicore Team
- **Technique:** User suggestion to use `head`/`tail` instead of line-by-line editing

---

**Project Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

The transformation from Commander-Keen to dalicore-mcp-client is complete. All systems operational, documentation comprehensive, build passing.

**Time to ship it.**
